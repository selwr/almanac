## Workflow for importing documents to Almanac

# Layout of windows
* There should be two spaces:
    1. Safari, not full screen, on Instapaper and any associated tabs
    2. Split down the middle, not full screen, with Downloads folder on the left, and almanac project folder on the right

# Process
* Open each of the articles in Instapaper in a new tab in turn
* Determine interest, and download if required; can check if paper/topic already in Almanac by searching for it
* Go to screen 2, rename download and drag to appropriate subject folder in Almanac
* Repeat for all articles in Instapaper
